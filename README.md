# Food_Tracker (Name: TBD)
## Introduction
### Purpose
The purpose of the Stress Eating Tracker is to track not only a user’s diet, but also what external and internal stressors and factors contribute to the diet. According to Pavlovian Theory, people’s behaviors can be triggered by certain stimulus and this tracker seeks to, over time, zero in on what stimulus cause users to eat. By doing this, the tracker can help users determine what factors and stimulus cause the hunger response and react accordingly.
### Intended Audience
Any person that wishes to track their diet/nutrition and/or learn what behaviors/stimulus cause that user to eat the way they do.
### Intended Use
Daily input of the user’s eating behaviors as well as stimulus they encounter.
### Scope
This application should allow users to track their diet in its entirety while also tracking any stimulus they share. Over time, the application should show users a correlation between stimulus and intake. 
The app will NOT be able to demonstrate causation, but will point out correlations. This will allow the user to determine if the stimulus are causing the reaction or if it is merely correlated.
